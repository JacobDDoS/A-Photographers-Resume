# A-Photographers-Website
React Project that is a parody of a photographer's website.

## Skills Used
* React
  * React Router
  * useState hook
* CSS
  * Flex
  * Grid

## Overall
This website was a fun little project to keep myself busy and to learn a little bit more about CSS, particularly responsiveness using flex and grid. </br>
There is a lot more I want to do with this to continue learning more about css, mainly about accessibility.

## Improvements
It could use a lot more styling, particulary transitions, animations, and accessibility. </br>
I think it could also benefit from some better spacing in some places as well as more content in general. The code itself could also use more comments and could be more organized.

## Credits
To build this site, I used many photos that I do NOT own. Credit to:

## Conclusion
It was overall a fun project where most of the website itself was through creativity and not excessive programming. It could use some improvement but for a first little project
it turned out pretty good.
